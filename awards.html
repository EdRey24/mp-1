                        <h3>2023 Congressional App Challenge Winner for the 15th Congressional District of Texas</h3>
                        <p>I participated in the Congressional App Challenge (CAC), an annual district-specific competition aimed at inspiring innovation in STEM, coding, and computer science education. The CAC, initiated by the Congressional Internet Caucus and supported by the Internet Education Foundation, provides students like me with a unique opportunity to showcase their original apps and creative solutions. Winning teams are publicly recognized by U.S. Representatives, and their apps may be displayed in the U.S. Capitol Building for a year. As a winner, I joined a select group of students challenged to develop and submit an app that demonstrates technical skill and creativity. My app Cash Alert offered a free solution for organizing school/community fundraisers through Google App Script, HTML, and Google Sheets, providing weekly email reminders and payment management to student organizations, addressing the limitations of costly and restrictive alternatives. This experience not only allowed me to hone my programming skills but also to engage with a broader community passionate about advancing technology and education. The CAC’s mission to inspire, include, and innovate aligns with my commitment to pursuing excellence in STEM fields, and I am proud to have contributed to this impactful initiative.</p>
